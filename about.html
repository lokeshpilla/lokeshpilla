                        <p class = "abouu">
                            I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote <br>"Les
                            Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher".<br> They
                            have influenced millions of people through their books.<br> I also wanted to
                            be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could
                            read peopleâ€™s mind.<br> Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet.<br> I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.<br> There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.<br> I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk,<br> I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night;<br>
                            I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.<br>
                            I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.<br>
                            I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.<br>
